  <div id="blurb"><p>The Rev. Gregory J. Boyle, S.J., is the founder of Homeboy Industries in Los Angeles, the largest gang intervention,
    rehabilitation and re-entry program in the world.
A native Angeleno, Father Boyle entered the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits)
 in 1972 and was ordained a Catholic priest in 1984.  He holds a bachelor’s degree in
 philosophy and English from Gonzaga University, a master’s degree in English from
 Loyola Marymount University, a Master of Divinity degree from the Weston School of
 Theology, and a Master of Sacred Theology degree from the Jesuit School of Theology
 at Berkeley...<a href=# onClick="show()"> Show More</a> </p>


<p id="show">After ordination, Father Boyle spent a year living and working with Christian base
communities in Cochabamba, Bolivia.  In 1986, he was appointed pastor of Dolores Mission
 Church in the Boyle Heights neighborhood of East LA.  At the time, Dolores Mission was
 the poorest Catholic parish in the city, located between two large public housing projects
 with the highest concentration of gang activity in Los Angeles. He witnessed the devastating
  impact of gang violence on his community during what he has called "the decade of death" that began
   in the late 1980's. In the face of law enforcement and criminal justice tactics and policies of suppression
   and mass incarceration as the means to end gang violence, Father Boyle and parish and community members adopted
   what was a radical approach at the time: treating gang members as human beings.<br> <br>

By 1988, having buried an ever growing number of young people killed in gang violence,
 Father Boyle and parish and community members sought to address the escalating problems
  and unmet needs of gang-involved youth by developing positive opportunities for them,
   including establishing an alternative school and day care program, and seeking out
   legitimate employment.  They called this initial effort Jobs for a Future.
   “Gang violence is about a lethal absence of hope,” Father Boyle has said.
   “Nobody has ever met a hopeful kid who joined a gang.”</p>
